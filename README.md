# AI Scientific Evaluation for Chemistry

This repository provides **frameworks and methodologies** for evaluating the scientific
accuracy, reasoning consistency, and plausibility of AI-generated chemistry outputs.

The work reflects modern practices in **AI-assisted scientific assessment**, aligning
with computational chemistry research standards.

## Scientific Motivation

As AI models increasingly support chemical research, it is essential to:

- Benchmark AI predictions against experimental or DFT reference data
- Identify inconsistencies or errors in AI-generated mechanistic proposals
- Evaluate reasoning and plausibility of reaction pathways
- Support decision-making in computational catalysis and reaction engineering

---

## Methodology

- Compare AI-generated outputs with validated DFT or experimental datasets
- Define quantitative metrics for plausibility, accuracy, and chemical consistency
- Track error sources and uncertainty in predictions
- Integrate Python-based analysis pipelines for reproducible evaluation

---

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- NumPy, pandas
- scikit-learn for benchmarking metrics
- matplotlib for plotting evaluation results
